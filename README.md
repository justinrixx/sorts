# sorts
Some standard sorting algorithms

This program is a collection of different sorts. Some are O(n^2), some are O(n log n). Also included is a
driver that keeps track of the number of comparisons and the number of assignments made in each sort. This
allows the user to compare each sort.

I didn't write all of these sorts, I did them with a partner (Nick Recht) and have his permission to share
them here (check the author at the top of each file)
